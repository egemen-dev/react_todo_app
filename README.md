I developed this todo app primarily to use it myself. The main goal was to make this app a pleasure to use on a daily basis, with the mentioned specs below.

## Specs and achievements
- Developed a mobile-first React Todo app with a user-friendly interface, allowing users to easily manage their tasks and mark them as complete, providing a seamless user experience.
- Utilized Tailwind CSS framework to create a responsive design, ensuring the app's layout and components adapt well to different screen sizes and orientations, providing a visually appealing experience on both mobile and desktop devices.
- Implemented a sortable list feature, enabling users to arrange their tasks in a preferred order for better organization and prioritization, enhancing productivity and task management capabilities.
- Integrated keyboard support to enable users to efficiently interact with the app using keyboard shortcuts.
- Additionally, leveraged local storage to save todos locally, allowing users to access their tasks even after closing the app or refreshing the page.
